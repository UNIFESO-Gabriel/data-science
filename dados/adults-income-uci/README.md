**Description of fnlwgt (final weight)**:

The weights on the CPS files are controlled to independent estimates of the
civilian noninstitutional population of the US.  These are prepared monthly
for us by Population Division here at the Census Bureau.  We use 3 sets of
controls. These are:

1.  A single cell estimate of the population 16+ for each state.
2.  Controls for Hispanic Origin by age and sex.
3.  Controls by Race, age and sex.

We use all three sets of controls in our weighting program and "rake" through
them 6 times so that by the end we come back to all the controls we used.
The term estimate refers to population totals derived from CPS by creating
"weighted tallies" of any specified socio-economic characteristics of the
population.

People with similar demographic characteristics should have
similar weights.  There is one important caveat to remember
about this statement.  That is that since the CPS sample is
actually a collection of 51 state samples, each with its own
probability of selection, the statement only applies within
state.
